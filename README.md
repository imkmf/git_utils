# git_utils

A nice collection of git utilities written in pure bash.

Note that a lot of these are provided by Git, but are wrapped in bash functions so you don't have to remember a bunch of optargs and things like that.

---

- is_git

Check if current directory is in a git repository.

`-s` will return a status code: "0" for a git repo, "128" if not. Echo `$?` to see the response:

```
is_git -s
echo $?
0
```

`-v` will return "TRUE" or "FALSE", along with the status code:

```
is_git -v
TRUE
echo $?
0
```

- number_of_commits

Number of commits for a repository.

```
number_of_commits
118
```

- top_commits_by_author

Top commits by author.

```
top_commits_by_author
